     how to test them 


good program stuff  
     make an md file 
     remove the firebase stuff and add an .env file 
     add comments to see what you did there
     add components to stuff to make it more modular 
     remove imports that dont matter 
     add json and documentation
     add what you have learned in the resumo proj
     optimize so you dont have unnecessary calls or calls that are the same 

other 
     publish database and site (change site on server side and server constructor)
